 One unlucky man in Wales searched a rubbish dump for a hard drive containing 7,500 accidentally discarded bitcoins, whose value had grown from almost nothing to $7.5m.

Ruchir Sharma, a strategist at Morgan Stanley's investment arm（投资部门）, argues that America's mounting debts may make cryptocurrencies more appealing. 

The total value of outstanding bitcoins exceeds that of Canadian dollars, narrowly defined to include banknotes and central-bank reserves. 

But few of the new crypto converts think it has any chance of replacing government money — the dream of early believers. 
但新加入加密货币阵营的人中，很少有人认为它有机会取代政府发行的货币——这是早期信徒的梦想。

It is far too inefficient to be of much use for making payments; 
far too inefficient：效率低得太多了 / 非常低效
be of much use：固定表达，意为“有很大用处”

bitcoin is capable of processing fewer than ten transactions per second

By contrast, the firms upending consumer finance, like Alipay and Venmo, minimise friction. 

Were that problem solved, governments would clamp down quickly on any technology that threatened their monetary sovereignty.

Regulatory resistance has already forced Facebook's mooted（提出的） digital currency, Libra, to rebrand (to "Diem") and scale back its early ambition. 
//slick digital currencies	精良的/流畅的数字货
Meanwhile, the competition is heating up as central banks improve payments systems and launch slick digital currencies of their own.

 Bitcoin mania is instead rooted in the possibility that it might eventually offer a safe store of value like gold,
 but more convenient (because it is easier to maintain a digital wallet than a physical vault). 



 Then it could win（可能赢得”或“有可能占据”） a small but permanent slice of investors' portfolios（投资者的资产组合）. 
 Like bitcoin, gold pays no interest or dividend. Unlike bitcoin, gold has fundamental uses, 

 but it is fluctuating demand from investors for the yellow metal, not jewellers and chipmakers, that drives prices.
 但推动金价上涨的，是投资者对这种“黄色金属”需求的波动，而非珠宝商和芯片制造商的需求 
 It is/was + 被强调部分 + that/who + 句子其余部分------- that 引导的是一个定语从句，修饰前面的 "it"，但它实际上起到的是连接作用，引出句子的真正谓语部分。

 // investor sentiment	投资者情绪

 It is therefore conceivable that bitcoin's high price could also prove self-sustaining.
因此可以设想，比特币的高价也可能是自我维持的

If bitcoin became as popular with investors as gold (measured by the market value of their positions) the price would rise to $146,000, calculates JPMorgan, a bank. 
(measured by the market value of their positions)  过去分词短语作补充说明，意为“以持仓市值衡量”


Already, millennial investors appear to prefer cryptocurrencies to bullion.
Already：副词，表示“已经”，强调事情正在发生
millennial investors：千禧一代的投资者（通常指1980年代至1990年代中期出生的人）
appear to prefer...：似乎更喜欢……
cryptocurrencies：加密货币（复数）
to bullion：黄金（金条、金块）

There are plenty of reasons to doubt that bitcoin can emulate gold. Its price is much more volatile and moves with the stockmarket, which is hardly desirable for a supposed haven. 
 The market is illiquid and cryptocurrency trading remains a wild west in which fraud and theft are rampant, and which facilitates crimes such as selling drugs online.
