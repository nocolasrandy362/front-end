1.
Achieve real-time streaming response display, optimize the loading experience of long texts, and enhance the smoothness of user interaction.
Design and implement components that support the upload of multiple formats of files, combining chunked upload and progress monitoring mechanisms.
Load and display historical information, ensuring the stability of large file transmission and the user experience.


2. Full-process development of the ordering function module:
Includes specification selection, dynamic price calculation, ordering confirmation page and information display functions.
Utilizes Vuex for cross-page state management to ensure consistency of user operation data.
Employs dynamic form validation rules to enhance data accuracy, optimize user submission experience, and reduce error rates.

3. Development of Data Monitoring and Visualization Module:
Based on ECharts, a multi-dimensional data monitoring dashboard is constructed to achieve dynamic rendering of line charts, bar charts, pie charts, etc.;
Support for time range filtering, data drilling, and real-time refreshing;
Package a reusable chart component library to enhance the development efficiency of the team;
Combine WebSocket to achieve real-time data updates of key indicators, enhancing the response capability of the monitoring system.

4. General Functionality and Experience Optimization:
Led the development of forms for multiple business modules, designing a unified form validation framework.
Integrated regular expression validation, asynchronous validation, and error notification mechanisms to increase the success rate of form submissions.
Optimized page loading performance by using lazy loading, component splitting, and code splitting to reduce the initial page loading time, significantly enhancing the user experience.

Participated in the front-end development of the Smart City Project in Guanggu, using axios to achieve data interaction with the backend.
Responsible for the linkage between the background interface points and the map page, as well as the display and hiding of map points.
Based on Vue-router, navigation guards were used to control the jumps between various interfaces, and different contents were displayed according to different permissions.
Used Vuex to implement component communication and other functions to ensure good interaction between pages and data communication.
Used Git for version control and cooperated with backend personnel to complete the front-end and back-end integration testing.

Based on methods such as SHAP algorithm for interpretability-based machine learning, the seismic data is analyzed and processed to effectively identify geological fault targets;
Using SQL statements to query the data, and using Python for thermal analysis and interpretability analysis of the data
