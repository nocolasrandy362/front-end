The Vue instance lifecycle refers to the different stages a Vue component goes through from its creation to its destruction. 
At each stage, Vue automatically calls specific lifecycle hooks, which allow developers to run code at key moments during the component’s life.

These hooks are particularly useful for initializing data, making API requests, manipulating DOM elements, or cleaning up resources like timers or event listeners.

Vue’s lifecycle can be divided into four main phases:

1. Creation Phase
These hooks are called when the Vue instance is being created.
beforeCreate
Called right after the instance is initialized.
At this stage, data observation, computed properties, methods, and events have not been set up yet.
created
Called after the instance has been created.
Data, methods, and events are now available. This is a good place to make API calls or initialize data.

2. Mounting Phase
The process in which a Vue instance first mounts a component and its template onto the DOM. 
At this stage, the component's template is rendered into HTML and inserted into the page, and the component also executes the corresponding lifecycle hooks.

beforeMount
Called right before the initial render happens and the template is compiled. ==> Called right before (A and B)
The $el property exists but hasn’t been mounted to the page yet.
mounted
Called after the component has been rendered and inserted into the DOM.
Ideal for DOM manipulation or initializing third-party libraries.

3. Updating Phase
These hooks are triggered when reactive data changes and the component re-renders.

beforeUpdate
Called when data changes, but before the DOM is re-rendered.
Useful if you need to access the DOM state before it is updated.

updated
Called after the DOM has been updated due to a data change.
Use this hook to perform operations that depend on the updated DOM.

4. Unmounting Phase
These hooks are called when the component is being removed from the DOM.
beforeUnmount(Vue 3) / beforeDestroy(Vue 2)
Called just before the component is destroyed.
This is a good place to clean up non-Vue resources such as timers, event listeners, or subscriptions.
unmounted(Vue 3) / destroyed(Vue 2)
Called after the component has been fully destroyed.
All directives have been unbound, and all event listeners removed.
